Final project for the Software Guild, meant to 
incorporate everything learned into a single,
full-stack web application.

The design goal was to create a CRUD app that
involved 5 different, interconnected data types
and SQL tables, along with a security-based,
stand alone table/type to store user information.

The context for the application is for the
logging of 'sightings' of superheroes and villains.
To do so requires the previous entry of locations,
powers, organizations, and supers.  

A sighting requires a location and at least one 
super to be entered into the system (can accept 
more than one) prior.

A super requires at least one power and one
organization to be entered into the system prior.

A little clunky, but those were the project
requirements passed down by the curriculum.
